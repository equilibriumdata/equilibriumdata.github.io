# THEREDA

## Historical

<a  href="https://www.thereda.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THEREDA</a> (Thermodynamic Reference Database) is a joint project collectively planned and executed since 2006 by German and Swiss research institutions which work in the field of final disposal of radioactive waste.

## Scope

The THEREDA project is dedicated to the creation of a comprehensive, internally consistent thermodynamic reference database. It provides thermodynamic data (including equilibrium constants) and Pitzer interaction coefficients which in conjunction with suitable codes allow for the calculation of solubilities of radio-toxic and chemical-toxic elements in electrolyte solutions up to high concentrations. The database is used for the geochemical modelling of processes in the near- and far-field of different host rock types, which are envisaged as potential sites for final repositories in Germany.

## Availability

Registered users have access (free of charge) to the different releases of the database and to all references, from which the released data sets were created, via <a  href="https://www.thereda.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.thereda.de/en/</a>.
